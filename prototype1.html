    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing, including light and other electromagnetic waves, is capable of possessing enough energy to escape it. Einstein's theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole. The boundary of no escape is called the event horizon.</p>
    <h2>Characteristics</h2>
    <p>In many ways, a black hole acts like an ideal black body, as it reflects no light. Moreover, quantum field theory in curved spacetime predicts that event horizons emit Hawking radiation, with the same spectrum as a black body of a temperature inversely proportional to its mass. This temperature is of the order of billionths of a kelvin for stellar black holes, making it essentially impossible to observe directly.</p>
    <h2>General Relativity</h2>
    <p>The general theory of relativity, Einstein's theory of gravity, is the geometric theory of gravitation published by Albert Einstein in 1915 and is the current description of gravitation in modern physics. Einstein's theory has astrophysical implications, including the prediction of black holes - regions of space in which space and time are distorted in such a way that nothing, not even light, can escape from them.</p>
